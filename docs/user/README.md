# 🟨 Amber - User Guide

Welcome to Amber! This guide provides everything you need to know as an end-user.

## 🎯 What is Amber?

Amber is a **library mod**, which means it doesn't add new features to the game on its own. Instead, it provides a foundation for other mods to work. Many mods use Amber to function across different mod loaders like Fabric, Forge, and NeoForge without requiring separate versions.

If a mod you've downloaded requires Amber, you've come to the right place!

## 🚀 Installation

1.  **Download Amber**: Get the correct version of Amber for your Minecraft version and mod loader from the official download page.
2.  **Install it**: Place the downloaded Amber `.jar` file into your `mods` folder, just like any other mod.
3.  **Run the game**: That's it! Any mod that depends on Amber will now work correctly.

There's no extra configuration needed. Just install it and let it do its job.
